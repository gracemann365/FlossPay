# Database Module (Optional)

This `database` module is a **placeholder for advanced or enterprise setups** where you may want to centralize all database schema management in one place.

---

## When to Use a Standalone Database Module

- **Centralize Migrations:**  
  Store all SQL/DDL scripts (e.g., [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/), Liquibase) here to manage schema changes shared across multiple services.
- **Database Documentation:**  
  Host ER diagrams, schema documentation, changelogs, or markdown guides for your database structure.
- **Entity Generation:**  
  (Rare) For very large monorepos, auto-generate Java entity classes from the schema here and share with all service modules.

---

## Typical Usage in Spring Boot Projects

- In most real-world Spring Boot projects, each service keeps its own migrations in  
  `src/main/resources/db/migration/` inside that service.
- **It's 100% fine** for this module to be empty, or you can delete it if you are not using a centralized DB workflow.

---

## TL;DR

- This module is an optional placeholder for future expansion.
- All critical migrations currently live in your main service’s `resources/db/migration` folder.
- Feel free to remove, ignore, or expand this module as your architecture evolves.
